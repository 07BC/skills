# Mr Will: Solve

## Problem → Understand → Fan out for fixes → Converge on one approach → Hand off to /workflow

---

## Overview

This command is a **diagnostic and solution-design panel** for a single bug or
architecture problem. A team of subagents understands the problem, fans out to
propose competing fixes, and converges on one approved approach. Its output is
an **approved fix-plan**, not code.

It is the missing front door to the implementation chain:

```
/solve            →  approved fix-approach  →  /workflow  →  PR
(diagnose + design)   (PLANS_DIR doc)           (implements known work)
```

Use `/solve` when you do **not yet know the fix** — a bug whose root cause is
unclear, or an architecture problem with several plausible approaches. Once the
approach is approved, `/workflow` implements it. `/solve` never writes
implementation code or opens a PR.

A locked, fully-specified plan is **not** a validated plan. If its success rests
on a load-bearing invariant that has never been empirically demonstrated — a
pixel/byte-exact match across two engines, an "X reproduces Y", or output pinned
to an oracle recorded under a *different* implementation (snapshot/golden
baselines from a prior renderer) — route it through `/solve` Phase 1 feasibility
**before** `/workflow` commits implementation hours. (This is the front door that
the Remove-KickText session skipped: a plan demanding a UILabel/TextKit renderer
pass CoreText-recorded baselines pixel-for-pixel, never re-recording, was
internally contradictory and burned ~5h before the contradiction was named.)

The orchestrator (Opus) owns every branching decision — which angles to fan out
on, which proposal wins, whether to loop. Subagents (Sonnet) explore, propose,
and attack; no subagent makes a branching decision.

**Input required before launching:**

- One of (auto-detected, positional):
  - A free-form problem description — the default
  - A Jira ticket key (e.g. `PROJ-123`) — auto-detected via `^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+$`
  - A file path naming the problem (a spec, a stack trace, a failing test) —
    auto-detected by file existence

## Variables

Define these once. Every later phase references them rather than restating
the paths or values.

| Variable | Source | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SUBAGENT_MODEL` | constant | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `PROJECT_NAME` | `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` | `myapp` |
| `PLANS_DIR` | `${HOME}/Developer/obsidian/${PROJECT_NAME}/plans` | per global plan-storage rule |
| `SOLVE_DOC` | `${PLANS_DIR}/solve/${slug}.md` | the single durable artefact this command produces |
| `slug` | kebab-cased problem title | `chatviewmodel-merge-message-arrays` |

When a phase says "spawn a Sonnet subagent" it always means
`model: SUBAGENT_MODEL, mode: normal`.

---

## Input — detect and normalise

Run as a single step:

1. **Normalise.** Strip a leading `@` if present (mention-style refs).
2. **Classify** the normalised argument:
   - Matches `^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+$` → `mode = jira` (read the ticket via Atlassian MCP)
   - Is a path to an existing file → `mode = file` (read it as the problem source)
   - Otherwise → `mode = prompt`
3. Derive `slug` from the problem title once understood; until then use a
   provisional slug.

Announce the resolved mode and argument before proceeding.

---

## Model Confirmation

State on a single line:

> Running as: [model name and version] — [plan mode / normal mode]

Do not proceed to Phase 0 until this line has been output.

---

## Phase 0 — Preflight

### Opus, plan mode

Apply skill `pipeline-preflight`.

When any signal fires (dirty working tree, drift, wrong base branch), ask the
user via `AskUserQuestion` with three options. The orchestrator owns what each
option does:

| Option | Orchestrator action |
| --- | --- |
| **Reconcile first** | Resolve the signal, then re-run pipeline-preflight. Do not proceed until it emits `Pre-flight clean.` |
| **Proceed anyway** | Record the override in the problem model (Phase 1, "Open issues"). Continue. |
| **Abort** | Halt with no blocked report. A user choice, not a failure. |

When preflight emits `Pre-flight clean.`, continue to Phase 1 without further
prompting.

> `/solve` is read-only with respect to the working tree — it never commits or
> branches. Preflight here is a hygiene gate so the diagnosis reflects a known
> state, not a setup step.

---

## Phase 1 — Understand

### Opus, plan mode

This phase ends with a **problem model** the rest of the panel reasons over.
It is also where the panel decides its own shape — this is the adaptive core.

1. **Read the problem.** Read `CLAUDE.md` and follow every linked doc. Read the
   problem source (the prompt, the Jira ticket, or the named file).
2. **Map the blast radius.** When the affected area is wider than the
   orchestrator can hold in context, spawn one or more **`code-explorer`**
   subagents (`agentType: feature-dev:code-explorer`) to trace the execution
   path and dependencies. Pass each a narrow question; never "read the whole
   module." Apply skill `subagent-reliability` if any returns no usable result.
3. **Clarify with the user.** Surface the genuine unknowns via `AskUserQuestion`
   — public-API constraints, observed-vs-allowed behaviour, what "fixed" must
   mean. Do not guess answers a one-line question would settle.
4. **Feasibility / contradiction check.** Before deciding the fan-out, prove the
   **Constraints & invariants** and the **Definition of fixed** are *jointly*
   achievable — not merely individually sensible. Reason explicitly (or spawn one
   adversarial verifier) over: *"Given these constraints and this definition of
   fixed, name the single contradicting pair, or state why they are jointly
   satisfiable. Default to infeasible when uncertain. Attend specifically to any
   invariant that pins output to an artefact recorded under a different
   implementation (snapshot baselines from another rasteriser, golden files from a
   prior engine) — that is the classic infeasible bar."* If infeasible, surface
   the contradicting pair via `AskUserQuestion` and require the user to relax a
   constraint or redefine "fixed" **before** fan-out. Do not spend the cycle
   budget converging candidates against an unsatisfiable bar. This is a
   contradiction read, not a re-litigation of intent — it fires only when a real
   constraint forbids the plan's own mechanism.
5. **Decide the fan-out.** Choose how many solver subagents to spawn (2–4) and
   the **distinct angle** each takes. Derive the angles from the problem — do
   not hardcode them. Examples of angle axes, not a fixed list: data-flow vs
   public-API surface; minimal-diff vs clean-redesign; preserve-behaviour vs
   change-the-contract; risk-first vs ergonomics-first.

Write the problem model to `SOLVE_DOC` with these sections:

- **Symptom** — what is observably wrong, or the architecture smell
- **Root-cause hypotheses** — ranked
- **Constraints & invariants** — what must NOT change (public API, observability, behaviour)
- **Blast radius** — files / types / call sites in scope
- **Definition of fixed** — the testable bar the chosen approach must clear,
  stated as executable verification (command, expected count of *executed* tests,
  the comparison oracle and its tolerances). For any cross-implementation rewrite
  (re-implementing a renderer, parser, or serialiser), the oracle MUST be
  re-recordable on human approval, or a structural/measurement assertion — never
  an immutable pixel/byte baseline recorded under the prior implementation.
- **Feasibility** — the contradiction-check verdict from step 4 (jointly
  satisfiable, or the relaxed constraint the user approved)
- **Fan-out plan** — the solver count and each angle, with one line of rationale
- **Open issues** — any preflight override or unresolved unknown

Do not propose a fix in this phase. Do not write implementation code.

---

## Solver Context Bundle

Build once, after the problem model is written. Pass inline in every solver and
verifier prompt so subagents never re-read `CLAUDE.md` or `SOLVE_DOC` from disk.

```
PROBLEM: <full contents of SOLVE_DOC at end of Phase 1>
CLAUDE_MD: <full contents of ./CLAUDE.md>
CONSTRAINTS: <the Constraints & invariants section, verbatim>
DEFINITION_OF_FIXED: <the Definition of fixed section, verbatim>
```

---

## Phase 2 — Diverge (fan out for fixes)

### Spawn N Sonnet subagents — normal mode, in parallel

Spawn one subagent per angle from the Phase 1 fan-out plan, each with
`agentType: feature-dev:code-architect` (the agent type confers the architect
behaviour — do not also cite it as a skill). Give each the **same** Solver
Context Bundle plus its assigned angle:

> You are designing an architecture, not implementing it. The bundle below is
> everything you need — do not re-read these files from disk.
>
> [solver context bundle]
> ANGLE: <this solver's assigned angle and its rationale>
>
> Propose ONE approach to fix the problem **from your assigned angle**. You are
> not implementing it. Return:
>
> - **Approach** — what changes, in terms of types / signatures / data flow
> - **Why it fixes the root cause** — tie back to the ranked hypotheses
> - **Invariants honoured** — how each item in CONSTRAINTS is preserved
> - **Migration & test impact** — what callers must change; what must be tested
> - **Risks & tradeoffs** — where this approach is weakest
> - **Confidence** — high / medium / low, with the deciding factor
>
> Do not hedge across multiple approaches. Commit to one and defend it.

**Retry budget: 1 attempt per solver to recover from a subagent-reported
failure.** Crash recovery (raw API error, timeout, socket-closed) applies skill
`subagent-reliability` first, before consuming the retry slot.

Return control to the orchestrator when all solvers report. The orchestrator
reads every proposal before continuing.

---

## Phase 3 — Converge and attack

### Opus, plan mode — with Sonnet adversarial verifiers

1. **Synthesise.** The orchestrator forms a single **candidate approach**. This
   may be one solver's proposal outright, or a merge that grafts the best idea
   from a runner-up onto the strongest base.
2. **Attack.** Spawn 2–3 Sonnet **adversarial verifier** subagents in parallel.
   Each is prompted to *refute* the candidate, defaulting to refuted when
   uncertain, each through a distinct lens (does it actually fix the root cause;
   does it break a stated invariant; does it introduce a regression or migration
   hazard):

   > [solver context bundle]
   > CANDIDATE: <the synthesised candidate approach>
   > LENS: <root-cause | invariants | regression-and-migration>
   >
   > Try to refute this candidate through your lens. Default to `refuted: true`
   > if you are not confident it holds. Return `{ refuted, reason }`.

   Apply skill `subagent-reliability` for any verifier that returns no usable
   result.
3. **Decide.** If a majority of verifiers refute, or no candidate survives,
   **loop back to Phase 2** with refined angles informed by the refutations.

**Cycle budget: 2 diverge↔converge rounds.** If round 2 still yields no
surviving candidate → halt + blocked report (see Halt Conditions).

---

## Phase 4 — Approve and hand off

### Opus, plan mode

1. Write the final, surviving approach to `SOLVE_DOC`, appending:
   - **Chosen approach** — the approved design
   - **Why this over the alternatives** — name each rejected proposal and the deciding reason
   - **Migration & test plan** — concrete enough for `/workflow` discovery to consume
   - **Definition of done** — restated from Phase 1, now testable against the approach
2. Present to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

   | Option | Action |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Approve & hand to /workflow** | Offer to launch `/workflow` with `SOLVE_DOC` as the spec-path input. |
   | **Revise** | Take the user's note and loop back to Phase 2 or Phase 3 as appropriate. |
   | **Stop here** | Leave `SOLVE_DOC` as the deliverable; do not launch `/workflow`. |

`/solve` never edits source or opens a PR. The handoff is the boundary.

---

## Halt Conditions

The orchestrator must halt and write a blocked report (never silently continue)
if:

- Phase 1 cannot establish a Definition of fixed because a required clarifying
  answer is not provided
- The Phase 1 Constraints & invariants and the Definition of fixed are jointly
  unsatisfiable and the user declines to relax either (do not fan out against an
  impossible bar)
- Every solver in Phase 2 fails after its retry slot
- The Phase 3 cycle budget (2 rounds) is exhausted with no surviving candidate
- A required Jira MCP call fails (Jira mode only)

On halt: write a summary of the problem model, the proposals seen, and why no
approach survived to `${PLANS_DIR}/solve/${slug}-blocked.md`.

If `mode = jira`: add a comment to the ticket linking the blocked report. Do not
transition the ticket — `/solve` does not own its lifecycle.

---

## Model & mode

**Opus orchestrates** in plan mode and owns all branching — the fan-out shape,
the synthesis, the loop-or-ship decision. **Sonnet subagents** explore
(`code-explorer`), propose (`code-architect`), and attack (adversarial
verifiers); none makes a branching decision. State is kept in the single
`SOLVE_DOC` under `PLANS_DIR` and passed to subagents by the inline context
bundle, never re-read from disk.
